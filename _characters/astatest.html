# documentation: 
#   code: The key for each character is used as the profile page identifier, e.g. asta2.html

#   main-body: 
#       Contains name, squad, type, rarity, class.
#       These are all filter values, used as data-<value> in the search page.
#       'new' is the value that generates the NEW tag on the search page.

#   profile: 
#       Contains grimoireCode, fullName, title, cards, stats, fateLinks.
#       Used to populate data in the indv profile page.
#       grimoireCode should be the same as the corresponding private grimoire key in grimoireData.json, used to generate link to grimoire page
#       stats contain a dictionary for the Base Stats table
#       fateLinks contains a list of character codes, the rest of the data will be auto populated.
#           - To hide the Fate Links card entirely, remove the variable.

#       cards: 
#           The key should follow the title of each card, can be overwritten by 'header'
#           Contains layoutTags, header, name, desc, pills, upgrades, ovrImgPath
#           layoutTags can be: no-name, no-pill, no-upgrades & no-img. Remember to include the single-quotes!
#           ovrImgPath should contain the path to the file except the extension. e.g. combat/Asta_skill_01

#           desc, upgrades: Each - indicates one line in the page
#           pills: Each - indicates one pill to be displayed

#   ovr: 
#       Contains pImgPath, sImgPath.
#       pImgPath overwrites profile images (search page & portrait in indv profile page)
#       sImgPath overwrites skill images (atk, skill & special in indv profile page)
#           - Note: ovrImgPath has a higher priority than these 2 as it is specific to a card
